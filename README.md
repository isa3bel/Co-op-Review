# Co-op-Review

Created a basic mock website using HTML and CS for a final project in Database course.

It is difficult for students at NEU to find a good co-op, so this front end website would help them know which co-ops would be the best option for them.
Students can look at reviews of co-ops from other students, and here first-hand the quality of the company and experience from the eyes of another student.
